        <h2 class="section-title">Hi, I'm Bradley!</h2>

        <span style=" #000000;">
            I am a Bootcamp student from Monash University, I'm motivated and eager to begin my career as a cybersecurity professional.
            With still so much to discover in the field, I have found enjoyment learning the skills of a cybersecurity professional.
            I have attended networking events with the chance to listen and speak to veterans of the field. I found speaking
            to them and listening to some of the problems they have faced and overcame intriguing.
            <br><br>
             On my blog, I cover a couple of interesting questions, sharing some information and my thoughts on the topics.

                <h3>Are humans really the weakest link in security?</h3>
                <h4>#AreHumansTheWeakestLink #CybersecurityWeakestLink</h4>
                <p>It's one of those questions that is often asked, as a security professional or as a student.
                   While humans are the ones that take action in creating security infrastructure, these infrastructures
                   are only capable of doing what its human creators have set in place.
                   <br><br>
                   The processes of securing a network does not happen automatically, rather they are a sequence set together by humans. Where any small misconfigurations
                   left in the security infrastructures foundation leading to a vulnerability, it's an opportunity for an attacker to find these vulnerabilities
                   and attack your system. Human misconfigurations cause the majority of server downtime or vulnerabilites.
                   <br><br>
                   It's not only the security professionals that are relied on to keep networks safe , but also it's users. Keeping personal accounts secure at all
                   times is a must, if your account is not safe, it is like opening another door for attackers to exploit. Using password generators is a great way
                   for new passwords to be created, and storing them in a password manager is a great way to keep track of your passwords keeping your accounts and passwords safe.
                   Another alternative for added security for your accounts is enabling multifactor authentication, adding another barrier to your account that only you have access to
                   using an authenticator app or your mobile number.
                   <br><br>
                   In conclusion, I do think that the Human factor is the weakest link. In security technology does not act on their own, rather they are instructed on what to do through the
                   process of algorithm. another consideration is that the everyday user may not be securing personal accounts, making vulnerabilities for attackers to exploit.

                <h3>Is artificial intelligence being used in the world of cyber security?</h3>
                <h4>#AIUsedInCybersecurity #AIInCybersecurity </h4>
                <p>
                    Today, we are approaching a world where artificial intelligence (AI) is starting to be implemented across all kinds of technologies, like laptops, phones and websites for example.
                    But what involvement does AI have in the cybersecurity world you might ask, you may be surprised to know that it is already being utilised for a number of tasks.
                    <br><br>
                    <br><br>
                   <h1 style="font-size:1.2vw">So what are the advantages?</h1>
                   <br><br>
                   <h1 style="font-size:1vw"><li>Using AI to strengthen password practices and privileges</li></h1>
                   AI can be used to implement additional security measures like facial recognition and or fingerprint scanning
                   to further secure privilege controls and password practices. AI can also be used to strengthen password practices
                   through identifying behavioural anomalies and suspicious login attempts, making it much easier for organisations
                   to identify threats or even combat ongoing threats.
                   <br><br>
                  <h1 style="font-size:1vw"><li>Threat detection and response</li></h1>
                   AI can be used in such a way that it can be used as a tool to identify threats and take action on them if required.
                   AI can analyse huge amounts of data in real-time analysing user behavior, system logs and network traffic while being capable of threat detection
                   with a very fast response time to suspicious activities and take the action of but not limited to, shutting down compromised accounts
                   or systems automatically and blocking IP addresses.
                   <br><br>
                   <br><br>
                   <h1 style="font-size:1vw"><li>Boosting the Human factor</li></h1>
                   AI can be used to increase many aspects of the human factor, resulting in a more effective and efficient workplace.
                   Earlier it was mentioned that human misconfigurations cause the majority of server downtime or vulnerabilites.
                   AI can be used to assist in the configuration of a network, or undertaking manual tasks helping minimize the potential
                   of accidental data leaks and misconfigurations that could lead to any potential security risks.
                   It is also common for AI to be implemented into the role of the day-to-day of a cybersecurity professional,
                   doing the more time consuming manual tasks so that more time can be spent on more in-depth threat analysis or mitigation and strategic initiatives.
                   <br><br><br>
                   <h1 style="font-size:1.2vw">But what are the disadvantages?</h1>
                   <br><br>
                    <h1 style="font-size:1vw"><li>Accuracy of processed results</li></h1>
                   Although AI can analyse huge amounts of data very quickly, the results may not always be accurate from unprepared data.
                   To incease the accuracy, organisations must invest into a data preparation process to organise and clean data. This investment will also
                   further secure data before being processed, by filtering out manipulated data known as data poisoning. Data poisoning can decrease an AI's accuracy
                   by considerable amounts, resulting in overlooked threats and wasted efforts by cybersecurity professionals.
                   <br><br>
                   <h1 style="font-size:1vw"><li>Data privacy and lack of transparency</li></h1>
                   For example, mentioned earlier AI can analyse user behaviour, but how does it know what is the normal behaviour for a user? Well, it may
                   need access to a users personal data to compare a users most recent behaviour. This could cause a potential data leak, it could be AI can analyse huge amounts of data in real-time analysing user behavior, system logs and network traffic while being capable of threat detection
